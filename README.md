## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Supabase Setup (For Cross-Device Sync)
To ensure your progress (opened hatches) is saved across different devices, you need a small backend. We use Supabase (it's free and easy).

1.  **Create Account**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up.
2.  **New Project**: Create a new project.
3.  **Database Setup**:
    -   Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard.
    -   Run the following SQL query to create the table:
    ```sql
    create table advent_progress (
      id bigint primary key generated by default as identity,
      opened_days jsonb default '[]'::jsonb,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );

    -- Insert the initial row for the user
    insert into advent_progress (id, opened_days) values (1, '[]');
    ```
    *(Note: We force ID 1 in the code for simplicity since this is a single-user app).*

4.  **Connect the App**:
    -   Go to **Project Settings** -> **API**.
    -   Copy the **Project URL** and **anon public** key.
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of this folder.
    -   Add your keys:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
    ```

### 3. Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Deploy
You can deploy this to Vercel or Netlify. Just make sure to add the Environment Variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) in your deployment settings.

## Customization
Edit `src/data/content.ts` to change the messages, coupons, and titles for each day!
